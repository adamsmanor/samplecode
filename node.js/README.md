# Sample Node.js code

chat-server.js and chat-config.json - A simple chat server, similar to a single IRC channel. Proof of concept for
using node.js.

To run the server, use "node chat-server.js" from the command line.

To connect to the server, "telnet localhost 4545" from the command line, or use a GUI client which allows telnet to random ports, such as Tera Term.
